# PacMenExercise
 Course Project: Pacmen added upon clicking "add Pacman" in stationary form then by clicking "start game" the pacman will start moving to the right of the page at a given speed before it hits the edge and bounce back. If you click on "add Pacman" again, it will add more pacmen to the page and if you click "start game" again, the pacmen will move faster.
 
How to Run: 
- Clone this repository
- Open index.html file
- Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to add more images facing the other direction with other colors so that not all pacmen start moving to the right of the page before they bounce back.
